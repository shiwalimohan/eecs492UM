* Revision of PEAS terminology
performance, environment, actuators, sensors
stress on why it is important to characterize a task.
* Properties of task environment
** Observability
- partially observable only if the unperceived information is
  /relevant/ to the action choice. eg: a cleaning agent vacuuming a
  room does not need to know about the weather to plan, make a decision.
- arises because of noisy sensors, lack of sensory data
** Single agent v/s multi agent
- difference between an /agent/ and an /object/.
- competitive, cooperative
** Determinism
- stochastic process generates next state
- also related to observability of the environment
** Episodic v/s sequential
different for different formulations
  - A single firefighting task is sequential, however one expedition
    does not affect others.
** Static v/s dynamic
environment changes during deliberation. strategy games v/s action games
** Discrete v/s continuous
continuous state, time, percepts, actions 
** Known v/s unknown
model of the environment v/s learning

* Examples 
| Domain                          |
|---------------------------------|
| Missionaries and Cannibals      |
| Super Mario                     |
| Robo-soccer                     |
| Driving domain                  |
| Fire-fighting domain            |
| Hand-written Number Recognition |
| Siri                            |

* Evaluation
- How to evaluate an agent's performance? Discuss wrt examples in the
  previous section. Evaluation should be done in multiple scenarios. 
  Introduce the concept of false positives/negatives; eg: hand-written
  number recognition.
