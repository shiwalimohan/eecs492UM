* Contraint Satisfaction
** Cryptogram
A cryptogram is a type of puzzle which consists of a short piece of
encrypted text such that each letter of the alphabet (A-Z) is mapped
to a different letter (A-Z). Spaces are preserved. The assignments are
consistent. \\
\\
*** <1-> Cipher 
=GEBO TEV E CWAACK CEGN=

*** <2-> Letter Map\\
=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz=\\
=trl.a.m...e..by...oh.di...=

*** <3-> Decrypted string: 
=MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB=

*** <4-> Used extensively in telegrams in World War I
Zimmermann Telegram: proposal from the German Empire to Mexico to make
war againts US. intercepted by the British and decrypted

** Cryptogram as a CSP
*** <1-> Cryptograms can be modeled as CSPs
*** <2-> Example Problem
=ABC DC EFG HGIIJK FBE=


1. What are the variables?
2. What is the domain of those variables?
3. What are the constraints?
** Cryptogram as a CSP
Cipher: =ABC DC EFG HGIIJK FBE=\\
Plain text: =?=

- <1-> Treating each word as a variable, identify word pairs that have a constraint between them. Draw a constraint graph.
- <2->  We use a dictionary to find the domain of each variable. \\
  =Dom(ABC) = Dom(EFG) = Dom(FBE) = {DOG, MAN, THE, HAT }=\\
  =Dom(DC) = {IN, MY, TO}=\\
  =Dom(HGIIJK) = {BATTER, SUDDEN, YELLOW}=\\
- <3-> Solve the cryptogram by using backtracking search (without forward checking) assigning variables from left to right.
- <4->  How would the search change if forward checking was allowed?

* Local Search
** Traveling Salesman Problem
*** A problem in graph theory requiring the most efficient (i.e., least total distance) Hamiltonian cycle a salesman can take through each of  cities.
*** <2-> No general method of solution is known, and the problem is NP-hard.
** Small Traveling Salesman Problem
A traveler needs to visit 4 cities. He knows the distance between each
pair of cities. His aim to figure out the shortest route that visits
all the cities.  \\
Distances between cities. \\
=A-B 6=\\
=A-C 1=\\
=A-D 5=\\
=B-C 3=\\
=B-D 2=\\
=C-D 4=\\
** Local Search for Traveling Salesman Problem
- State space: a set of all possible tours, e.g. ABCD, ACBD etc
- Operators: change position of adjacent cities within the current tour
- Heuristic function - length of the tour
- Initial State - ABCD

- Distances between cities. \\
   =A-B 6=\\
   =A-C 1=\\
   =A-D 5=\\
   =B-C 3=\\
   =B-D 2=\\
   =C-D 4=\\

- Perform steepest descent.



* Homework
** Pay attention to
- algorithms specified in the homework questions.
- difference between a 'state' of the world and a 'node'
